## About
Daruma is a project that I worked on over the summer to create a mechatronic version of the traditional japanese goal-setting talisman. The cad files and basic code are included in this repo.

The current electronics setup is primarily just to test core features of the hardware. I want to add IOT capabilities to this project soon to connect to to-do lists and other similar services, so I'll release designs for this new circuit board and a parts list as this gets finalized.

Enjoy!
